# k4cpizz cool sway - A cool config. 
A kick-ass Sway config. Made for myself.
This repo includes configs for: Waybar, Sway and Kitty (terminal)

# NOTE: 
I had problems with Waybar on non-systemd distros (Artix), on Alpine Linux i just had to install KDE Plasma using setup-desktop, the fix is probably the same on Artix Linux. Also to run the script YOU NEED BASH!!!
