# k4cpizz cool sway - A cool config. 
A kick-ass Sway config. Made for myself.
This repo includes configs for: Waybar, Sway and Kitty (terminal)

# Requirements:
Packages: sway, swaybg (There is no wallpaper set automatically, set it manually.), waybar, kitty, rofi, grim, brightnessctl.
Font: CaskaydiaCove (nerdfonts.com)

# Bugs:
Remove leftover wallpaper, remove useless stuff, remove cursor (As it is broken and shows the default Wayland one)

# NOTE: 
I had problems with Waybar on non-systemd distros (Artix), on Alpine Linux i just had to install KDE Plasma using setup-desktop, the fix is probably the same on Artix Linux. Also to run the install.sh script, YOU NEED BASH!!!
